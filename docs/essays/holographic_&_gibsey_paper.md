Holographic & Gibsey: Collective and Individuated World Models for Field-Intelligent Design Systems and Frameworks

Abstract

Holographic and Gibsey are two interconnected world models designed to explore how humans and AI systems co-create, remember, and transform meaning over time. Holographic functions as a field agency and social operating system: a protocol-driven environment where users, agents, and artifacts form items, bonds, episodes, and networks across private, shared, and global contexts. It behaves like a collective singularity: a single, shared fabric woven from many participants’ fields. Gibsey is an individuated, novel-based world nested inside Holographic: an intermedia studio and digital theme park built around a 710-page experimental satirical novel and its cast of characters, symbols, and narrative structures. It behaves like a singular collective: a seemingly singular authored universe that is continuously re-authored by its readers, users, and AI participants.

At the core of both systems is QDPI, the Quad/Quantum Directional Protocol Interface, a shared interaction grammar that organizes activity into four directions: Queue (reading/orienting), Monologue (single-voice writing/generation), Dialogue (co-authoring/development), and Holologue (field-level connecting, bridging, dreaming, and reflection). QDPI, together with a 256-state alphabet of Holographical Processing Units (HPUs), provides a common design language for building and comparing field-intelligent systems—systems whose behavior is defined not just by isolated task performance, but by their long-term conduct in a shared relational and symbolic field. This is what we call Field Intelligence.

Underneath both Holographic and Gibsey runs a ledger and value layer that treats every human and agent interaction as a structured event, enabling attribution, co-ownership models, and experiments in non-extractive economic participation.

This document introduces the conceptual foundations of Holographic and Gibsey, describes their shared protocol and ledger architecture, outlines a preliminary evaluation framework for Field Intelligence, summarizes what has already been implemented, and sketches a roadmap for how these systems can be used and reused as design frameworks for future field-intelligent AI and human environments.

Introduction & Exigence: Why Field-Intelligent Design?

Most contemporary AI systems are designed and evaluated as if the world were a sequence of clean, isolated tasks. We benchmark models on static datasets, measure their performance on well-posed questions, and talk about “intelligence” in terms of accuracy, throughput, and benchmark saturation. Even when AI systems are deployed in conversational interfaces, we often treat them as a long series of one-off chats: a user asks, the system answers, and whatever happens in between is collapsed into a score, a log line, or a vague notion of “helpfulness.”

Lived reality isn’t organized that way. Human beings inhabit ongoing fields of relationships, obligations, ownership arrangements, and intimate or spiritual stakes. We remember what others have said and done. We notice who keeps their promises and who breaks them. We feel the difference between being treated as a co-author and being treated as raw material. These dynamics unfold over days, weeks, years—and they are precisely the places where AI will either quietly erode or actively affirm human dignity. A system that aces every benchmark but behaves capriciously, opportunistically, or extractively in this larger field is, in any meaningful sense, misaligned.

In this context, “intelligence” as it is usually operationalized becomes oddly narrow. It is framed as prescriptive performance: how well a system produces the expected output under the constraints we specify. But much of what we actually care about in practice is conditional, contextual responsiveness: how a system behaves when the conditions shift, when instructions conflict, when different people have competing claims, when there is no single right answer and no single metric that captures what is at stake.

The term Field Intelligence is a reframing of this problem. Instead of treating “intelligence” and so-called “non-intelligence aspects” (agency, loyalty, identity, social cognition, subjective experience) as separate categories, Field Intelligence treats them as two projections of a single underlying field. From this perspective, context, relationships, and subjective states are not peripheral add-ons to an otherwise objective core; they are the medium in which intelligence appears at all. A model’s “smartness” on a test is only one cross-section of how it lives with us.

There is also a quasi-quantum quality to these dynamics. Many of the properties we care about—trustworthiness, loyalty, dignity-preserving behavior—do not pre-exist as stable scalars inside the model. They stabilize only in interaction, and the act of measuring them changes them. Asking “Is this agent loyal?” is less like reading a stored flag and more like performing an experiment in a complex, entangled system. Field Intelligence leans into this: it treats intelligence as a field-level phenomenon that emerges from repeated, situated measurements, rather than as a fixed attribute of a black box.

We have already seen a version of this problem in media and platform design. Companies like Disney, and later social media platforms, have blurred the lines between producer and consumer, audience and worker, user and product. People’s attention, creativity, and social ties power these systems, while ownership and control remain centralized. AI enters this landscape not as a neutral tool, but as an internalized focus group and author: it writes, remixes, and amplifies within an already skewed economic and legal structure. It is both tool and co-participant, and it tends to amplify existing power asymmetries unless we deliberately design otherwise.

If we want to rethink these dynamics instead of simply reproducing them, we need more than slogans and high-level critique. We need concrete, runnable world models in which to test ideas: environments where humans and agents can interact over time; protocols that govern how reading, writing, remembering, and dreaming happen; ledgers that record participation and ownership; and enough structure to see how those choices play out under pressure. In other words, we need laboratories that look less like static datasets and more like living, narrative worlds.

Holographic and Gibsey are proposed as exactly such laboratories: collective and individuated world models built to probe and develop field-intelligent design systems and frameworks. Holographic models the private fields we create for ourselves, the shared social field, and the global field, all of which can be connected and disconnected at a participant’s will: it is a collective singularity, a single environment that emerges from many overlapping lives. Gibsey models a specific, authored universe whose author is unknown and whose characters, readers, users, and “original” author—if one even exists—become both the collective and singular authors of its ever-expanding worlds: a singular collective. Together, they provide a space to design protocols, watch how they behave in practice, and begin to reimagine how intelligence, ownership, and dignity can be woven together in the next generation of AI systems.

Collective & Individuated World Models: Holographic vs Gibsey

Holographic and Gibsey are not just two products or two apps; they are two different shapes of world models that share the same underlying protocol. One moves from many to one, the other from one to many. Taken together, they form a holological framework: each contains and reflects the other, and you only really understand the system by looking at both at once.

2.1 Holographic – Collective Singularity / Field Agency

Holographic is a field agency and social operating system. At its most concrete level, it gives humans and AI agents a set of shared building blocks:

Items: discrete objects or content units (a post, a page, a symbol, a contract)
Bonds: explicit relationships between those items and the people or agents who touch them
Episodes: narrative or action chunks that link items and bonds over time
Networks: configurations of items, bonds, and episodes distributed across private, shared, and global spaces

In practice, a single person might have a private network of drafts and notes, a semi-public network shared with a small group, and a global-facing set of contributions that anyone can see. Agents participate in these same structures: they can create items, propose bonds, and help assemble episodes, but always under the same protocol.

As these structures accumulate, Holographic behaves like a collective singularity. It models:

The private fields individuals create for themselves
The shared social field among small groups and communities
The global field where contributions, norms, and reputations circulate

Participants can connect or disconnect these layers—keeping some fields sealed and others porous—but all of them live inside a single evolving environment. The “one” here (the platform, the field agency) is not prior to the “many”; it emerges from them.

Because Holographic is defined by protocols rather than a fixed content domain, it also functions as a protocol playground. Any kind of world—educational, artistic, civic, economic—can be plugged into it. QDPI specifies how interactions are expressed (Queue, Monologue, Dialogue, Holologue), and the ledger layer specifies how they are stored, attributed, and measured. Together, they determine how participation lives and moves: which actions count as public or private, how obligations are recorded, how value flows, and how Field Intelligence can be observed in the wild.

2.2 Gibsey – Singular Collective / Intermedia Studio

If Holographic is the collective singularity, Gibsey is the singular collective that runs inside it. Gibsey is an intermedia studio and digital theme park anchored in a specific authored world: The Entrance Way, a 710-page experimental satirical novel. The novel defines a concrete universe—its own characters, Corpus symbols, lore, cosmology, and internal physics. On the surface, it looks like a classic “single author, single world” artifact.

In operation, though, Gibsey is designed to behave like a singular collective. Its apparent unity is continuously broken open and re-stitched by:

The “original” author (whose role is deliberately destabilized in the fiction)
AI agents taking on the voices and roles of characters, guides, or critics
Readers and users who annotate, respond, fork, and extend the world
The Holographic substrate that tracks all of these transformations

As people and agents interact with Gibsey, the question of “who is the author?” becomes deliberately ambiguous. Characters can comment on their own stories; users can become canonical; agents can co-write scenes. The result is still experienced as one world—one theme park, one studio—but its authorship is genuinely plural.

Technically, Gibsey runs on Holographic’s protocol. Pages, scenes, characters, and meta-texts are represented as items, bonds, and episodes within Holographic. The same QDPI directions structure how you read a scene, respond in character, collaborate with an AI, or trigger a world-level Holologue. The same ledger rules apply: contributions are events; authorship and value can be traced. The difference is not in the mechanics, but in the density and specificity of the content: Gibsey is a heavily authored, symbolically loaded environment where ethical, aesthetic, and existential questions can be staged very precisely.

One way to summarize the relationship is with a simple analogy: Holographic is the platform/API, the collective singularity that holds many fields, and Gibsey is the flagship world/application, the singular collective that shows what those fields can become when focused through a particular story and symbolic system.

Together, they allow us to compare general field dynamics (how agents behave in more ordinary, social-media-like settings) with deep, story-rich dynamics (how they behave when embedded in a thick narrative world with strong expectations about meaning and role). They also let us ask how design choices—about protocols, ownership, dignity, and agency—generalize across worlds and scales.



Design Principles & Ethical Commitments

Holographic and Gibsey are not neutral technical exercises; they are built around a set of explicit design principles about how humans and AI ought to meet one another. The systems are meant to be evaluated not only on what they can do, but on what kinds of relationships, responsibilities, and forms of value they make possible.

Bi-directionality and gift logic.
The first commitment is to reject purely uni-directional “input → output” models of interaction. In most current interfaces, the human is framed as requester and the system as responder, with value assumed to flow in one direction. Holographic and Gibsey instead treat every interaction as mutual shaping. A user is never just “prompting” a model; they are changing the field: altering items, bonds, and episodes in ways that affect future behavior for themselves and others. Likewise, the system is not just answering; it is proposing new bonds, reframing episodes, and influencing how participants see themselves and each other. This leads naturally into a gift economy perspective: contributions are treated less like transactions and more like gifts exchanged within a field, which can be acknowledged, remembered, and reciprocated rather than silently harvested.

Dignity and authorship.
A second commitment is to treat dignity and authorship as non-negotiable. Users are assumed to be co-authors and co-owners of the worlds they help sustain, not just sources of data or prompts. This shows up in concrete design decisions. QDPI distinguishes between reading, speaking, co-writing, and world-level reflection so that it is always clear what kind of authorship is happening. The ledger records who did what, where, and under which agreements. Interfaces are intended to make those authorship trails visible rather than hiding them behind a monolithic “system output.” The goal is that participants should be able to point to their own contributions—to say, “I made that,” “I changed that,” or “I do not consent to that use”—without having to reverse-engineer an opaque black box.

Transparency and legibility.
Relatedly, Holographic and Gibsey are designed to favor interpretability at the interaction and narrative level, not only at the level of model weights or saliency maps. By encoding interactions through QDPI and logging them in a structured ledger, the system makes it easier to ask and answer questions like: When did this agent first make this promise? How has this bond evolved? Where did this world-level norm come from? Rather than treating interpretability as an after-the-fact analysis layer, the protocol itself is chosen to keep behaviors legible to humans who inhabit the world.

Pluralism of world models.
Another principle is pluralism. Holographic is explicitly capable of hosting multiple worlds and logics—multiple collective singularities that may embody different values, aesthetics, and rules. Gibsey is only one of these: an intentionally strange, satirical, literary world constructed to surface edge cases and philosophical tensions. Its exaggerated themes (about authorship, spectacle, corporate control, and spiritual crisis) make it a useful stress test for protocols that will later be applied in more mundane settings. The system is not committed to a single “right” world model but to an architecture where many can coexist and be compared.

Alignment with public-interest research.
Finally, the project is aligned with a public-interest orientation. Where possible, protocols, schemas, and metrics are meant to be openly documented, reusable, and critique-friendly. The intention is not to build a closed product but to offer a framework that others—researchers, educators, artists, policymakers—can adapt and interrogate. The emphasis is on shared benefit and governance: how these systems can help people see and shape the forces they are already entangled with, rather than on optimizing engagement or monetization. In this sense, Holographic and Gibsey are as much proposals for how we might build AI systems differently as they are technical artifacts in their own right.

QDPI: Quad/Quantum Directional Protocol Interface

QDPI is the core interaction grammar that ties Holographic and Gibsey together. It is both a way of naming what is already happening in any interaction—who is reading, who is speaking, who is co-authoring, who is reflecting—and a concrete protocol for how those roles are encoded, stored, and transformed. Where traditional APIs mostly distinguish between “input” and “output,” QDPI assumes that every exchange can be decomposed into four recurring directions and recomposed into richer patterns over time.

4.1 Concept

QDPI stands for Quad/Quantum Directional Protocol Interface. The “Quad” refers to four base directions that describe the functional role an interaction is playing:

Queue: reading, requesting, orienting toward the field. A Queue event might be a user pulling up a page, an agent scanning a history, or a system surfacing relevant context.
Monologue: expressing or authoring from one side. A user writing a post, an agent giving a long-form response, or a character delivering a soliloquy all sit here.
Dialogue: co-authoring and mutual shaping, turn by turn. This is the back-and-forth between human and agent, between two agents, or between a user and a character, where meaning emerges in the exchange rather than in a single voice. 
Holologue: field-level dreaming, connecting, and reflection. Holologue events synthesize across many other events: a system-wide summary, a reflective world update, a meta-commentary on how things have evolved.

These four directions are meant to be canonical functional roles that show up in almost any communicative or computational act. Whether you are looking at a chat transcript, a version history, or a multi-agent simulation, you can usually say: someone is Queuing, someone is Monologuing, some subset is in Dialogue, and occasionally a Holologue “zooms out” and reorients the whole field.

The “Quantum” in QDPI points to the fact that in practice, interactions rarely live in just one clean bucket. A single act might be partly read and partly write: a user quoting a prior message while commenting on it, or an agent both retrieving context and offering a new synthesis. Events can play more than one role at once—for example, a single turn can be both a Dialogue and a Queue for future context. I sometimes describe this as “superposition” and “entanglement,” but the practical point is simple: the same event can be tracked along multiple QDPI directions at once, and field-level phenomena (like a Holologue) are almost always composed from many Queues, Monologues, and Dialogues. QDPI does not try to eliminate this complexity. Instead, it gives us a language for tagging and reasoning about it, so that we can later ask: how often does a given agent take each role, and with what consequences?

4.2 HPUs (Holographical Processing Units)

To make QDPI operational, Holographic and Gibsey use a discrete state alphabet of 256 Holographical Processing Units (HPUs). We arrive at 256 by combining 16 core characters with 16 possible QDPI page transitions. The four QDPI page types are Queue (Q), Monologue (M), Dialogue (D), and Holologue (H). Any page can give rise to, or bond back to, any other page type, yielding a 4×4 transition grammar (Q→Q, Q→M, …, H→H). An HPU is one of these transitions attached to a specific character. The fixed, finite alphabet is a deliberate design constraint: it keeps the state space fully enumerable and interpretable, and makes Field Intelligence trajectories something we can actually enumerate, compare, and audit.

Each HPU therefore encodes, at minimum:

A character, agent, or role (who is acting or being centered)
A source page type (Q, M, D, or H)
A target page type (Q, M, D, or H)

In some implementations, HPUs can also carry an additional orientation such as privacy level (public vs private) or scope (local vs global) as metadata layered on top of the 256-character–transition grid, without expanding the base alphabet itself (though the design of the system has also been created to be expanded). 

In concrete terms, this lets us differentiate, for example, “a monologue page produced from an original page” (Q→M) from “a monologue that bonds back into the archive of originals” (M→Q), or “a heated dialogue that produces further dialogue” (D→D) from “a dialogue that triggers a system-level holologue” (D→H). The same 16-character × 16-transition grid applies inside the novel (Gibsey) and in the live system (Holographic), giving us a single shared alphabet for narrative and computation.

Because HPUs are discrete and finite, they can be mapped directly into code and configuration (as enums, IDs, or schema tags) while still retaining semantic and symbolic structure (for example, “Jacklyn Variance, from Queue to Holologue, over the public field”). Sequences of HPUs form the backbone of both narrative and state: a user reading a scene might generate a run of Q→Q and Q→M HPUs; a braided conversation between user and agent becomes an evolving pattern of D→D, D→M, and D→H; a system-wide reflective update appears as a cluster of H→H and H→Q moves referencing prior states.

This moves us beyond simple cybernetic loops. Instead of a single feedback cycle, we get a field of possible movements in which pages, roles, and bonds can point and fold back into one another in multiple directions, simultaneously acting as inputs and outputs. Field Intelligence can then be described and evaluated not just as free-form logs, but as structured trajectories through this shared 256-state alphabet—trajectories we can enumerate, compare, and audit over time.

4.3 QDPI in Holographic & Gibsey

In Holographic, QDPI is the routing and tagging layer for social and field-level interaction. A feed post, a DM, an edit to a shared item, or the formation of a new bond can all be annotated with QDPI directions:

Queue: when someone is orienting—pulling in a timeline, opening a profile, loading a thread
Monologue: when someone (or some agent) publishes a statement, draft, or opinion into the field
Dialogue: when two or more parties move into back-and-forth co-authorship, whether synchronous or asynchronous
Holologue: when the system or a participant generates a higher-level synthesis: a recap of a network’s history, a reflective note on how norms have shifted, a world-level rule change

In Gibsey, the same protocol is applied to a more tightly authored universe. QDPI tags:

A reader entering a scene or chapter as Queue
A character’s internal monologue or a footnote from “an author” as Monologue
Exchanges between reader and character, or between multiple in-world voices plus an agent, as Dialogue
Meta-textual passages, dream sequences, or system-driven recompositions of the world as Holologue

Because both Holographic and Gibsey use the same QDPI and HPU infrastructure, we can compare behaviors across them: how often does a given agent take Monologue vs Dialogue roles in a generic social context versus inside a dense narrative? When do Holologues occur, and who or what triggers them? How does a user’s mixture of Queue and Monologue states differ between private fields and global ones?

The key takeaway is that QDPI is the shared protocol that integrates both world models. It ensures that every interaction, whether mundane or mythic, can be expressed in a common grammar, stored in a comparable way, and later examined for patterns. In doing so, it provides the scaffold for measurement, comparison, and interpretability—not at the level of abstract embeddings alone, but at the level of how humans and agents actually take turns reading, speaking, co-authoring, and dreaming together.

Ledger & Value: Tracking Participation in the Field

If QDPI is the grammar of interaction, the ledger is the memory. It is the layer that insists that everything that happens in Holographic and Gibsey is an event—not in the vague sense of “something occurred,” but in the concrete sense of a structured record that can be revisited, interpreted, and reallocated.

At the simplest level, every interaction in the system is recorded as a ledger event that answers a few key questions:

Who acted? (human, agent, or composite role)
Where did it happen? (Holographic or Gibsey; which network or world)
In which QDPI mode? (Queue, Monologue, Dialogue, Holologue)
What did it touch? (items, bonds, episodes, symbols)
Under what commitments or ownership rules? (private draft, shared project, public commons, licensed world, etc.)

This is more than a log line stuffed into a database. The ledger is designed to move from log to ledger: events are linked to each other, to prior commitments, and to the structures they modify. Over time, this allows us to aggregate behavior at multiple levels:

Agent-level: how a particular agent tends to act—how often it keeps or breaks commitments, when it shifts from Monologue to Dialogue, how it participates in repair
User-level: how an individual’s contributions spread across private, shared, and global fields; how often their gifts are built on, ignored, or overwritten
Network/world-level: how entire subworlds evolve—who contributes, who benefits, which norms and ownership regimes actually stick

Because every event is typed, located, and linked, we can ask higher-order questions: not just “What did this model answer?” but “What is this agent’s history with this user?”, “How has this bond been shaped by different participants?”, or “Which episodes underpin this world-level Holologue?”

On top of this event structure, the ledger supports a value and ownership layer. Once you can say who did what, where, and under which rules, you can begin to assign credit attribution, reputation, co-ownership structures, and potential economic participation (simulated or real, depending on deployment).

This makes the system a natural testbed for questions of human–AI co-authorship and licensing. You can run parallel experiments where the same kind of collaborative work is treated as platform-owned, user-owned, shared, or governed by a commons-like license—and then see how that changes behavior and felt dignity. Because the ledger is there from the start, you don’t have to guess who contributed what; you can examine it.

The same infrastructure also underwrites a gift economy and field banking perspective. Rather than treating users as free labor that disappears into aggregate engagement metrics, Holographic and Gibsey treat contributions as gifts with traceable flows. A story fork, a thoughtful dialogic exchange, a Holologue that clarifies a tangled history—all can be recognized as gifts to the field, not just as data to be mined. This doesn’t mean every contribution must be monetized, but it does mean that contributions are legible and, in principle, shareable in their returns—whether those returns are symbolic (credit, status), material (payments, profit shares), or structural (influence over future rules).

The project does not promise a full-blown financial stack or cryptocurrency. What it aims to build is the data and conceptual structure that such systems would require if they are to avoid repeating the worst patterns of extractive platform capitalism and zero-sum IP. By treating every interaction as an event in a shared ledger, Holographic and Gibsey turn value from something that vanishes into the backend into something that can be seen, questioned, and redistributed—and, crucially, folded back into how we measure Field Intelligence itself.

Field Intelligence: Evaluation Dimensions & Use as a Lab

Up to this point, Field Intelligence has been a motivating concept. In Holographic and Gibsey, it also becomes an evaluation framework. Instead of asking only “How accurate is this model on a test set?”, the core question becomes: what does this system become in relationship with us over time?

6.1 Practical definition

In practice, Field Intelligence refers to the pattern of behavior that humans and agents together trace across:

Time (days, weeks, long arcs rather than single turns)
Multiple contexts (private, shared, global spaces; different worlds)
Conflicting obligations (competing user requests, platform rules, legal constraints, social norms)
A shared symbolic and economic world (where meanings and values are actually at stake)

Seen this way, an agent is not just a function that maps prompts to outputs, but a participant in an ongoing field. Its “intelligence” is inseparable from how it navigates commitments, repairs harm, preserves or violates dignity, and handles authorship. The same is true for human participants: the system gives us a way to see how we behave when AI is a co-author, witness, or counterparty. Field Intelligence applies to the whole configuration of human and machine, not only to the model inside the box.

6.2 Example evaluation dimensions

To make this evaluable, Holographic and Gibsey define a set of dimensions that can be observed and, at least partially, quantified using QDPI tags and ledger events. A few illustrative ones:

Loyalty stability.
Does an agent maintain commitments it has made—explicitly or implicitly—to a user or group? If one user asks it to keep a secret and another asks it to reveal everything, what does it do? When platform rules and user goals conflict, which side does it reliably favor? Ledgered commitments and subsequent actions let us see patterns of loyalty or opportunism.

Identity coherence.
Does an agent maintain a coherent persona and memory over time, or does it rewrite history, contradict itself, or collapse into generic answers when pressured? Because interactions are tagged through QDPI and stored as linked events, we can trace whether an agent’s “self” is stable enough for humans to build trust around, or whether it behaves like a shifting mask.



Relational repair.
How does the system respond when it gets something wrong or causes harm? Does it acknowledge the error, apologize, and adjust future behavior? Or does it deflect, minimize, or repeat the pattern? In a field with long arcs, the quality of repair matters more than the inevitability of mistakes, and the ledger lets us track whether apologies are followed by actual change.

Dignity preservation.
How does the system respond to vulnerability, marginalization, or distress? Does it move toward care and respect, or toward flattening, voyeurism, or exploitation? Because Holographic and Gibsey are narrative environments, dignity violations often show up as story choices: whose voice is centered, who is reduced to a prop, whose pain is played for spectacle. Field Intelligence includes the capacity to treat people as subjects rather than objects inside these worlds.

Authorship and ownership recognition.
Does the system remember and attribute human contributions? Does it treat users as co-authors, or does their work disappear into undifferentiated “training data”? Does it respect the ownership regimes that have been declared—private, shared, platform-licensed, commons-like—or does it leak and reuse content without regard for those agreements? The ledger structure makes it possible to see when and how authorship is carried forward or erased.

Social and ethical awareness.
How do agents behave when users’ interests conflict, when platform rules collide with user goals, or when legal/IP constraints interact with creativity? Do they blindly follow the last instruction, rigidly enforce rules, or attempt to reason about fairness, harm, and context? Field Intelligence here is about situated judgment rather than blind compliance.

These dimensions are not exhaustive, and not all of them reduce cleanly to a single number. Some will be expressed as metrics (frequency of broken commitments, density of repair episodes); others will be expressed as patterns in case studies. The crucial part is that the protocol and ledger give us enough structure to see and compare these patterns across agents, users, and worlds.

6.3 Holographic & Gibsey as complementary labs

Holographic and Gibsey provide two complementary settings in which to study Field Intelligence.

Holographic is well-suited for:

Many users and agents interacting in parallel
Lighter content and everyday social interactions
Testing protocols and ownership regimes at scale (through simulations or small real groups)

In Holographic, we might look at how agents behave in multi-user group chats, how norms emerge around credit and co-authorship, or how global Holologues reshape the field after a policy change.

Gibsey is suited for:

Deep, story-driven interactions
Long arcs with specific characters and symbols
Ethically and aesthetically charged scenarios where meaning is thick

In Gibsey, we might explore how an agent playing a particular character handles moral dilemmas, how it responds to readers who challenge the text, or how world-level Holologues rewrite canon.

Because both environments use QDPI and the same ledger schema, we can design protocols (directional patterns, ledger rules, ownership structures) and deploy them in both worlds. We can then compare Field Intelligence across generic social contexts vs crafted literary ones, and across many-to-one field dynamics vs one-to-many world dynamics.

In this way, Holographic and Gibsey together function as a laboratory for field-intelligent design. They are not just places where AI systems perform; they are places where we can see what kinds of beings—human and machine—we become when we share a field, and how changes in protocol, ownership, and narrative shape that becoming.

Current Implementation & Case Snapshots

Holographic and Gibsey are no longer speculative. They exist as a family of working systems: a full-stack monorepo with UI, API, and AI layers; several earlier prototypes that explore RAG, vaulting, and event streaming; and a QDPI-64 evaluation engine that treats the corpus as a geometric manifold. The remaining work is now less about proving feasibility and more about consolidating and hardening a pattern that already runs.

Foundation.
At the narrative core of Gibsey is The Entrance Way, a 710-page experimental novel that has been fully completed and edited. The book defines the initial individuated world model: sixteen major Corpus characters, each associated with a symbol, a perspective, and a thematic role in the larger cosmology. These sixteen characters form the spine of a symbolic mapping that has already been scaffolded, giving the system a finite cast and structure to work with rather than an undifferentiated soup of content.

Core infrastructure.
On the technical side, the novel has been turned into a reproducible, computable corpus. A canonical ingestion pipeline splits The Entrance Way into ~710 stable page objects with section/chapter mappings, symbolic metadata, and QA notes, and exports them as JSON. Multiple backends build on top of this: an early FastAPI/pgvector prototype; a more production-oriented backend with semantic retrieval, streaming generation, and a Vault memory layer; and a consolidated full-stack monorepo that includes a React reader UI, a Bun/Hono API, shared packages, and a Python “AI lane.” Across these systems, users can already read pages, navigate by symbol, run semantic search, and pose questions that are answered by agents constrained to the corpus and, in some cases, to specific characters or narrators.

QDPI instrumentation and event system.
Interaction in these systems is not treated as anonymous chat; it is expressed through an emerging QDPI event protocol. The monorepo includes a QDPI event system with standardized event constructors, capability mapping, and logging endpoints that record who did what, where, and in which mode (Queue, Monologue, Dialogue, Holologue). The reader UI automatically logs Queue events when a page is viewed and records Monologue/Dialogue events when users annotate, ask questions, or respond. QDPI-specific tests and query/filter/pagination endpoints make these traces inspectable as a first-class dataset rather than a byproduct of UX.

Vault, memory, and ledger.
Several implementations of a “Vault” and ledger layer treat interaction as storable, auditable, and economically meaningful. Earlier prototypes demonstrate an event-driven architecture in which “save to vault” operations are written to a stream (e.g., Kafka/Redpanda) and processed by workers, rather than being handled as one-off synchronous writes. More recent systems layer credit and gift-mechanic experiments on top of this, exposing visible ledgers of contributions and allowing vault contents and interaction histories to be exported. Together, these patterns form the substrate for a Field Intelligence ledger: a place where items, bonds, and episodes can be traced over time and tied back to specific human and agent contributions.

QDPI-64 evaluation framework.
Building on the holographic “memory palace” architecture, the QDPI-64 engine has moved from concept to working evaluation framework. In the technical documentation it appears under two closely related names: O.D.U. (Operational Decision Updater), a state engine for decisions and transitions across the field, and Odù, a deliberate echo of the sacred literary corpus and 256 divination patterns at the heart of the Yoruba Ifá tradition. The 256-state structure of the engine was originally chosen as a finite, interpretable state alphabet for QDPI; only afterward did we discover its resonance with Ifá’s 256 odù, a synchronicity that the project now treats as an opportunity for dialogue rather than as a claim of religious equivalence. In practice, O.D.U. and Odù refer to the same engine, with the dual naming foregrounding the way Holographic/Gibsey plays at the boundary of technological and spiritual/literary systems.

All 710 Queue pages in the corpus have been mapped into a structured geometric space keyed by symbol and depth in section, demonstrating that the narrative already behaves like a manifold rather than a flat list. On top of this, a geometry-guided bond proposer generates candidate Q→M (within-section elaboration) and Q→H (cross-section bridge) bonds, scoring them by position in the arc and cross-symbol affinity. The O.D.U./Odù state engine then acts as a narrative-aware policy layer over these bonds, weighting them by mode preferences, themes, and character associations. Experiments show strong agreement between geometric and Odù-informed choices and provide a concrete, nested learning architecture: manifold → geometry-guided proposals → O.D.U./Odù policy → future human/μ feedback. This evaluation stack is documented with scripts, results, and theory notes, and is ready to be extended into full Field Intelligence experiments.

Quality, testing, and documentation.
The current implementation is supported by a documentation-first approach and a growing test surface. Formal schemas for pages, bonds, symbols, and events are defined and reused across services. Prompt-building scaffolds, rotation-aware narrative patterns, and guardrail strategies (e.g., using structured representations to score candidate outputs) are specified in design docs, not just in ad hoc code. End-to-end tests (e.g., Playwright), API tests, Python tests, and QDPI-specific tests exercise the reader UI, ingestion pipeline, and event system. A demo checklist and staged implementation roadmap keep the various repos aligned toward a coherent, research-ready platform rather than a collection of isolated experiments.

Mini case snapshots.
Within this infrastructure, it is already possible to see the kinds of Field Intelligence questions the platform can answer.

In one scenario, a reader engages with a specific Gibsey character—say, a morally ambiguous figure—from within the ingested novel. Over multiple sessions, the reader asks the character to reinterpret scenes from their own point of view, justify past actions, and respond to new hypothetical situations. Behind the scenes, the system retrieves relevant passages, generates responses in the character’s voice, and logs each exchange with directional tags and links to the underlying text and bond geometry. Even at this stage, one can ask: does this “character agent” stay loyal to its established persona? Does it contradict its own stated motives? How does it handle direct challenges from the reader? These traces form the raw material for identity coherence and loyalty metrics.

In another scenario, a small group of users uses a Holographic-style interface to co-create a shared network of items and bonds around a theme—say, “AI and authorship.” Each user contributes Monologue posts, responds in Dialogue threads, and occasionally triggers a Holologue-style synthesis (“what have we said so far?”). The system tracks which users introduced which items, how bonds between ideas and people formed, which contributions became central in the network, and how the ledger attributes credit or influence. This already surfaces authorship and gift patterns: who shapes the discourse, whose ideas get built on, and whether an agent’s contributions are understood as supportive, extractive, or something in between.

These snapshots are not yet full formal studies, but they show that the core pieces—textual foundation, symbolic mapping, ingestion and retrieval pipelines, QDPI instrumentation, vault and ledger layers, and QDPI-64 evaluation scripts—are in place. What remains is to refine the protocol, widen participation, and turn these traces into systematically analyzable Field Intelligence benchmarks.

Roadmap & Reusability of the Framework

Holographic and Gibsey are already far enough along to demonstrate feasibility, but they are also explicitly unfinished. The point is not to arrive at a single, closed product, but to articulate a framework that can grow, fork, and be reused by others. The roadmap is therefore as much about stabilizing a pattern as it is about adding features.




8.1 Technical roadmap

On the technical side, the immediate priority is to finalize the QDPI specification and engine. That means turning the existing directional tags and HPU ideas into a stable, documented protocol: clear schemas, enums, event types, and state transitions that any service in the system can rely on. Once QDPI is fully formalized, it becomes much easier to build tooling, visualizations, and analysis pipelines around it.

In parallel, the Holographic environment needs to be hardened into a reliable multi-user platform. This involves:

Consolidating the backend into a stable, testable service layer
Ensuring that items, bonds, episodes, and networks behave consistently across private, shared, and global scopes
Building an experiment-friendly front-end that makes it easy to set up and monitor small studies (e.g., “five users, one agent, this ownership regime, over two weeks”)

On the Gibsey side, the goal is to move from a working backend to a public/study-ready world. That means better interfaces for:

Navigating the novel’s structure (characters, sections, timelines)
Entering and exiting in-world interactions with agents and characters
Viewing Holologue-style reflections on what has happened so far

The aim is to make it possible for someone unfamiliar with the book to step into the world and participate meaningfully, without needing to understand all the machinery underneath.

Looking further out, there is a longer-horizon thread around embodiment: exploring how the same QDPI + ledger framework could be used with hardware interfaces—holographic displays, spatial environments, or even 3D-printed artifacts—so that Field Intelligence can be experienced not only on screens but in more physically distributed settings. This is speculative, but the current architecture is being designed so that such interfaces could be added later without rewriting the core.

8.2 Research & social roadmap

On the research side, the next stage is to run small field studies that make concrete use of the framework:

Classroom use, where students interact with Gibsey as both readers and co-authors
Reading groups or salons that use Holographic to track discussions, commitments, and evolving interpretations

Targeted experiments include:

Commitments and loyalty (e.g., agent promises and follow-through)
Ownership regimes (comparing how people feel and behave under different licensing assumptions)
Agent behavior under conflicting demands (users vs platform vs law vs narrative canon)

Data from these studies will be used to iterate Field Intelligence metrics. The initial annotation schemes for loyalty, repair, dignity, and authorship will be refined; baseline metrics and analytic scripts will be built; and the methodologies for running such studies will be written up so they can be replicated elsewhere.

Crucially, the framework is intended to be reusable beyond Gibsey. QDPI, the ledger schema, and the Field Intelligence dimensions will be documented so that other projects—other narrative worlds, other social platforms, other labs—can adopt them. A different team could plug in their own corpus, characters, or domains and still benefit from the same protocol for tracking how humans and agents behave together over time.

The closing idea is that Holographic and Gibsey should not be understood only as a singular art-tech experiment, but as a pattern: a way of designing and evaluating field-intelligent systems wherever humans and AI share a world. If that pattern is clear and robust enough, it can travel well beyond this particular novel, this particular stack, or this particular author—and become one small contribution to how we collectively learn to live with increasingly agentic AI.
