PAGE 3 – The Five Layers of the Field

Title: FIELD – The Five Layers

Think of Gibsey as a column from pure math at the bottom to a student asking a question at the top.

Layer 0 – Math & Metal
The physics: vectors, matrices, GPUs, kernels, memory, bandwidth.

Layer 1 – Models & Code
The software body: Python, PyTorch, transformers, custom field-aware models.

Layer 2 – Field Intelligence
How the field reads itself: RAG, vector search, retrieval tricks.

Layer 3 – Field Architecture & Data
The operating system of the field: microservices, QDPI log, Kafka, DBs, scaling, reliability.

Layer 4 – Interaction & Agents
The lived experience: users, characters, QDPI protocol, UI, evals, guardrails.

We expand each below.
