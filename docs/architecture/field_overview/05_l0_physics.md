Title: L0 – Math & Metal: Physics of the Field

This is the physics of the field:

HPUs, pages, Vault entries, and QDPI events are turned into vectors.

Distances and angles between vectors define “field geometry” — how closely related two moves are.

CUDA kernels run the matrix multiplies and attention operations needed for:

Embeddings

Transformer forward passes

Vector search
