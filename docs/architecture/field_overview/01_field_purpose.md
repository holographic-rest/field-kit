Title: FIELD – Purpose of the Field Overview

This document describes the Gibsey / Holographic Field as a single, layered system:

What the field is: a living memory + inference space grounded in The Entrance Way, the Vault, and QDPI events.

How the field is implemented: from linear algebra and GPUs up through microservices, RAG, and agents.

How a single interaction moves through the stack.

How the field learns about itself and improves over time.

This is meant to be a high-level but technically clear overview for:

Future collaborators / engineers.

BKC / research partners.

Your own architectural sanity.
