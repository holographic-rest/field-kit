Title: FIELD – Summary

10. Summary

Engineering ladder (Math & Metal → Models & Code) defines the mind and body available to the field.

System design (Field Architecture & Data) defines the world the field lives in — how it stores, moves, and protects information.

RAG and Field Intelligence define how the field reads and cites itself.

Interaction & Agents define how humans and characters meet within that world, governed by QDPI, HPUs, and ethical guardrails.

Together, these layers implement Gibsey/Holographic as a public-interest field:
a space where human readers, AI agents, and a 710-page novel can co-create a living, auditable, and governable memory.
