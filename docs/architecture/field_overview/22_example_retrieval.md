8.4 Retrieval (Layer 2 on Top of Layer 3)

The Orchestrator calls Gibsey Index Service:

Query expansion + multi-query: several field-aware rephrasings.

Hybrid + graph-based + recursive retrieval:

Semantic + lexical search.

Graph walks: Princhetta ↔ show runners ↔ telepathy ↔ captivity Holologues.

Sentence windows + auto-merging:

Pull relevant paragraphs and merge adjacent ones.

Temporal decay + metadata filters:

Prefer this student’s recent Vault entries touching Princhetta.

Respect privacy, experiment scope.

Reranking + cross-encoder + MMR:

Fast first-pass ranking.

PyTorch cross-encoder re-scores top candidates.

MMR picks a diverse set (multiple angles and characters).
