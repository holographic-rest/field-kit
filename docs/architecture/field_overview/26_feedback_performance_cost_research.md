PAGE 26 – Learning & Research Feedback Loops (Part 2)

Title: FEEDBACK – Performance, Cost, and Research Goals

From Performance & Cost (Layers 0–3) → Serving Choices (Layer 0 & 1)

Tracing + metrics show hot spots.

We respond with:

Quantization (AWQ/GGUF).

Better batching / vLLM configuration.

Adjusted rate limits, token limits, or caching strategies.

From Research Goals (BKC, etc.) → All Layers

New research questions (“how do agents hold commitments over time?”) may:

Evolve the QDPI schema (Layer 3).

Shift retrieval focus toward longitudinal traces (Layer 2).

Motivate new models (commitment detectors, stability metrics) (Layer 1).

Require different serving patterns or trace labels (Layer 0 & 3).

Adjust evals & guardrails (Layer 4).
