Title: L0 – Math & Metal: Why It Matters

Why it matters

Distributed training is how we could eventually train field-specific models (rerankers, classifiers) across multiple GPUs on The Entrance Way + Vault + QDPI logs.

Quantization (AWQ / GGUF) lets us run smaller models locally:

Lightweight agents, guards, rerankers on modest hardware (school labs, laptops).

Inference optimization (vLLM, batching, paged attention) + high-throughput serving:

Make it possible to handle hundreds of simultaneous QDPI calls (classrooms, experiments) without meltdown.

Question answered: Can the field move at all, for many people, without overheating?
