PAGE 18 – Layer 4: Evals, Guardrails, and UI

Title: L4 – Interaction & Agents: Evals & UI

What this layer does (continued)

Evals & Guardrails

Automatic and/or human-in-the-loop checks:

Grounding & citation accuracy.

Polyphony & diversity of sources.

Safety & ethical constraints (esp. in classroom use).

Persona integrity (“this is Arieol, not generic AI”).

Guardrails enforce non-negotiable boundaries:

No leaking private Vault content to other users.

No violations of agreed ethical constraints.

Client/UI

The Entrance Way pages (primary corpus) on the left.

Vault timeline along a time axis.

Chat/agent responses on the right.

Live updates via WebSockets (“Princhetta is speaking…”).

Question answered: When a human stands in front of the field, what shows up?
