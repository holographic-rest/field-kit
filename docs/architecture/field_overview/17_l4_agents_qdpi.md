PAGE 17 – Layer 4: Agents & QDPI

Title: L4 – Interaction & Agents: Agents & QDPI

What this layer does

This is the lived experience when someone uses Gibsey.

Agents (Princhetta, Arieol, Old Natalie, etc.)

Implemented as ReAct-style entities:

Think (interpret the question & field state).

Act (call tools: Index, Vault, QDPI log, web).

Observe (tool output).

Think again and respond as the character.

Tools exposed via MCP-like protocol or bespoke QDPI tool schema.

QDPI Protocol

Queue = user’s ask.

Monologue = agent/system response.

Dialogue = iterative back-and-forth.

Holologue = field-level reflection or meta-commentary.

HPUs encode: who is centered, which QDPI direction, which orientation (public/private, local/global, etc.).
